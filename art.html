                Lift your head, baby don't be scared
                Of the things that could go wrong along the way
                You'll get by with a smile
                You can't win at everything but you can try
                Baby, you don't have to worry
                'Cause there ain't no need to hurry
                No one ever said that there's an easy way
                When they're closing all their doors
                They don't want you anymore
                This sounds funny but I'll say it anyway
                Girl, I'll stay through the bad times
                Even if I have to fetch you everyday
                We'll get by if you smile
                You can never be too happy in this life
                'Cause in a world where everybody
                Hates a happy ending story
                It's a wonder love can make the world go round
                But don't let it bring you down
                And turn your face into a frown
                You'll get along with a little prayer and a song
                Tidididi, tidididi, tidididi, didi, didi, dididi
                Let me hear you sing it

                It's a wonder love can make the world go round
                But don't let it bring you down
                And turn your face into a frown
                You'll get along with a little prayer and a song
                Tidididi, tidididi, tidididi, didi, didi, dididi
                Let me hear you sing it
                Tidididi, tidididi, tidididi, didi, didi, dididi
                'Cause in a world where everybody
                Hates a happy ending story
                It's a wonder love can make the world go round
                But don't let it bring you down
                And turn your face into a frown
                You'll get along with a little prayer and a song
                Lift your head, baby don't be scared
                Of the things that could go wrong along the way
                You'll get by with a smile
                Now it's time to kiss away those tears goodbye
                Tidididi, tidididi, tidididi, didi, didi, dididi

                You can't win at everything but you can try
                Baby, you don't have to worry
                'Cause there ain't no need to hurry
                No one ever said that there's an easy way
                When they're closing all their doors
                They don't want you anymore
                This sounds funny but I'll say it anyway
                Girl, I'll stay through the bad times
                Even if I have to fetch you everyday
                We'll get by if you smile
                You can never be too happy in this life
